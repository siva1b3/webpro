<p>
  chicken <b>(Gallus gallus domesticus)</b> a domesticated junglefowl species,
  with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1]
  that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an
  adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has
  been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually
  immature female is called a pullet.

  Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their
  meat and eggs) and as pets. Traditionally they were also bred for
  cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens are one of the
  most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7
  billion as of 2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more
  chickens in the world than any other bird. There are numerous cultural
  references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and
  literature.[citation needed] Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal
  origin theories of within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[3] but
  the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated
  from the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to the
  Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in Egypt in the mid-15th century BC, with
  the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria
  and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[4][5][6] They
  are known in Greece from the 5th century BC.[7][8] In 2011 a study in genetic
  and archaeological[9] evidence conclude that the origin of the modern-day
  chicken is from Southeast Asia.
